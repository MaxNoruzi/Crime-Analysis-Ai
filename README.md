# 📊 Crime Analysis – Data Mining Project

This project analyzes real-world crime data to uncover hidden patterns and trends using data mining and machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and association rule mining to support insightful decision-making.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  Handles missing values, removes outliers, encodes categorical features, and normalizes text with lemmatization and stopword removal.

- 📅 **Statistical Crime Trend Analysis**  
  Compares crime occurrence patterns across days of the week grouped by offense type.

- 🔍 **Frequent Pattern Mining**  
  Uses the **Apriori** algorithm to discover frequent itemsets and association rules based on time, location, and crime types.

- 🤖 **(Optional) Crime Prediction**  
  Provides a framework for training a stacking classifier (Random Forest + Logistic Regression) to predict incidents (currently commented out).
